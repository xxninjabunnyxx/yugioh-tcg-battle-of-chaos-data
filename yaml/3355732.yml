desc: If a face-up card is in a Field Zone, you can Special Summon this card (from
  your hand). You can only Special Summon "Icejade Kosmochlor" once per turn this
  way. While "Icejade Cenote Enion Cradle" is on the field, monsters your opponent
  controls can only activate their effects the turn they are Summoned. If your "Icejade"
  monster battles an opponent's monster, that opponent's monster loses 1000 ATK during
  that damage calculation only.
